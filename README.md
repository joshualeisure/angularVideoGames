# NgVideoAngularApp

While still in progress, I am creating an Angular 11 project using a public API to create a video game database. The API is called RAWG Video Games Database and provides many details like popularity and rating. I began the project by using Angular CLI and then I created components, http calls using HttpClient module for the API, http interceptors to intercept incoming and outgoing HTTP requests, and services within the project. I also performed data passing with routes (RouterModule and Routes) and pipes as well as Angular directives like ngFor and ngIf statements. Other classes I used were HttpHandler and Injectable for dispatching requests, HttpRequest for outgoing requests such as headers, and Observable and observableThrowError for passing messages between components. For styling, I used SCSS and mat-form-fields, mat-select, and mat-option. 
The main features the user has is the ability to sort different categories of the video games based on popularity, release date, etcâ€¦ Eventually, the user will be able to view the details of the game such as the plot and trailers. 



## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
